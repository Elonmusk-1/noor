# Telegram Bot Idea: File Filter and Direct Link Generator

## 💡 Bot Overview
Create a **Telegram bot** that can:

1. **Monitor a specific Telegram channel** for uploaded files (documents, videos, audios).
2. **Store file information** (file names, file IDs, message links).
3. **Respond in groups** where the bot is added.
4. **Search files by name** based on user input.
5. **Send clickable buttons** with direct download links.

| Inline Buttons | Bot replies with buttons linked to files. |
| In-memory or Database Storage | Save file details temporarily or permanently (for production). |
